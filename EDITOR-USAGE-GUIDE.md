# AmphiTweet Editor Guide

## Inserting Images in your scene
    Amphitweet currently runs on low server resources. Thus, we need to leverage other services to store some of our data. This however will change in the near future, as the platform grows.
    Currently, Amphitweet editor supports only remote images (images hosted by a service provider). 
    There are a lot of free cloud image hosting services out there.
